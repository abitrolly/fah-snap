summary: Folding@home is a distributed computing project.
description: |
 Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics, including the process of
 protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together citizen 
 scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. 
 Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and providing new opportunities for 
 developing therapeutics.
 
 This package contains the console client which is used to download  and run Folding@home work units, the 3D simulation 
 viewer and the control application.

parts:
  # This part installs the `desktop-launch` script which initialises desktop
  # features such as fonts, themes and the XDG environment. It also installs
  # the GTK2 runtime libraries.
  #
  # It is copied straight from the snapcraft desktop helpers project. Please
  # periodically check the source for updates and copy the changes.
