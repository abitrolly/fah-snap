# Folding@Home - Help research with distributed computing.

**I am One in a Million**: Regardless if you are already folding or haven’t heard a word about 
it before, we need your help to reach our goal – which is 1 million folders.
**Start folding now**

## What is it?
**Folding@home (FAH or F@h)** is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics, 
including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases.
It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. 
Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and providing new opportunities 
for developing therapeutics.

## More info
Folding@Home is run by Pandegroup of Stanford University. You can find more information on
